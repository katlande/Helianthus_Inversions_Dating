**Analyze the SNAPP output**

SNAPP outputs several files, but for our purposes the only important one is [example.log](https://github.com/katlande/Helianthus_Inversions_Dating/blob/master/output_analysis/example.log), which can
be converted into a [csv file](https://github.com/katlande/Helianthus_Inversions_Dating/blob/master/output_analysis/example.csv) containing the distribution of factors, including tree height, from all SNAPP runs.

To estimate divergence time, a [control csv file](https://github.com/katlande/Helianthus_Inversions_Dating/blob/master/output_analysis/Annuus_Argophylus_Control.csv) was previously generated by running SNAPP on non-inverted regions of two *Helianthus* species
with a known divergence time **LINK PAPER** of 1MYA. 

Using this control to calibrate tree height into a measurement of MYA, this R script **LINK** is used to determine the age of the
inversion of interest, and to calculate the confidence interval in MYA.
